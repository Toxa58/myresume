			<p class="my-descr">I’m a Developer located in Ukraine. I design and code beautifully simple things, and I love what I do.
				I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent.
				I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills
				and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease. I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career.</p>

					<p class="work-period">December 2022 - May 2023   |   Ukraine</p>
					<ul class="work-duties-items">
						<li class="work-duties">I'm crazy about games, that's why I want to create my own game. I understand that this is a very complex and voluminous project, so I decided to ask my experienced friend for help.</li>
						<li class="work-duties">He had a huge experience in this field, developed such games as Hello Neighbor, Goat Simulator and of course he had his own course which I successfully completed. After completing the course I received basic knowledge and general understanding of how to work with Unreal Engine and what problems may arise when creating a game. After some time I managed to make my first mini-project In which I showed everything I was capable of and this was where my first steps in the Game Industry began.</li>
						<li class="work-duties">I started looking for vacancies on different sites and one day on <a href="https://www.work.ua/"><span class="project-item-link">Work.ua</span></a> I find a vacancy from the company <a href="https://midnight.works/"><span class="project-item-link">Midnight Works</span></a>. After I passed their test task which they liked and I was invited for an interview. And then I was accepted into the team and I started my journey as a Game Developer.</li>

					<h3 class="work-experience-position">Game Developer <span class="work-experience-company"><a href="https://midnight.works/">Midnight Works</span></a></h3>
					<p class="work-period">May 2023 - February 2024  |   Remote</p>
					<ul class="work-duties-items">
						<li class="work-duties">I worked in a friendly team that could always answer my questions and support me in difficult times. Our first project was the game <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNFiR0Dr6uXJXgGbswhwgHl3oUJ3JAep/view"><span class="project-item-link">Dinosaur Hunt</span></a> where we play as a hunter who got to an island with dinosaurs and he needs to find a way to survive and get out of this island. Everyone had their own job and my main task was to put everything together and provide the final result. </li>
						<li class="work-duties">For about 7 months I developed a project on Unreal Engine with my team, a game in the genre first-person shooter. Game where you play as a hunter and kill dinosaurs on an uninhabited island. The game has 75 levels, great plot, features about 15 types of dinosaurs, 10 guns and 5 types of bullet's. All the mechanics were written by myself ;)</li>
						<li class="work-duties">Of course, during the development process I encountered many problems such as the problem of compiling the project, problems with transferring the version, making mistakes in writing code and, of course, problems in using Git. But I didn't give up and eventually I successfully submitted my work. We gave the game for porting, the game was supposed to be on console and PC And everything was ready for this, but the game was not released. Of course I was interested in this issue, but no one gave me a specific answer. We were simply given a new task to do a new project. </li>
						<li class="work-duties">When the development of the second project began I was forced to leave the company due to my own reasons. About 10 months I worked in this company and I do not regret it at all. I met a lot of cool people who helped me to be one step closer to my dream </li>

					<p class="work-period">July 2024 - Up to now  |   Remote</p>
					<ul class="work-duties-items">
						<li class="work-duties">When I solved all my problems, I started looking for a job again. I posted my portfolio on different sites and one day an indie company wrote to me and was interested in my skills. They offered me to make a sequel to the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2166530/Rich_Teddy_Adventure/"><span class="project-item-link">Rich Teddy Adventure</span></a> which has already been posted on Steam. This project interested me very much and of course I agreed. </li>
						<li class="work-duties">This game is about a bear who is called upon to restore balance in the Universe by collecting crystals on different planets. My friends set me the task of more extensively revealing the entire theme of the game and of course coloring the game with new fresh mechanics and all the features of Unreal Engine 5. </li>
						<li class="work-duties">At the moment I am one of the developers of this game, the game is in the final stage of development I am working on optimizing the project for PC and publishing the game on Steam and of course we are working on the visual part of the game. I have put a lot of effort into this project and it shows all my abilities, all my knowledge, all my skills in making games like no one else. That is why the game will soon be available to everyone and I will finally realize my dream.</li>
						<li class="work-duties">The question that probably immediately comes to mind is why am I looking for a new job ? It's simple, I live by this, I like what I do and I'm ready for new experiences and new ideas. I want to develop in this area and I'm looking for like-minded people who can help me. I am fully open to cooperation and ready to fulfill all project requirements on time.</li>
